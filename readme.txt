This project represents the reference dashboard for developers that will allow managing the subscription to API by integrating with the AWS marketplace. It is a fork of an aws project to which they have been added:
1) project management
2) bot management with text editor and syntactic highlighter
3) dataset management
4) concept management and training training set
5) job management and scheduling logic

We believe that the release of the sources can help developers in developing more complex system integration solutions by having a concrete example of integration with our SDKs and the AWS stack.

The version is subject to updates and will not be immediately consistent
